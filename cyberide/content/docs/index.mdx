## Welcome to Your AI Code Generation Assistant

This application is built to accelerate modern development workflows by combining advanced research in AI-powered code generation with long-term memory and structural consistency.

Right now, the application is focused on **generating and reasoning about code** ‚Äî using cutting-edge models and tools to deliver fast, clean, and reliable results across common programming languages.

## Powered by Research

Our system is built on two recent advancements in AI-driven software tooling:

---

### <AiOutlineCode /> PurpCode

**PurpCode** introduces a new approach to code generation that is **purpose-aware** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt just complete code, it builds toward long-horizon development goals.

üîó [Read the PurpCode Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19060) <FaExternalLinkAlt size="0.8em" />

> _‚ÄúPurpCode enables prompt-driven programming with structured decomposition, letting the model scaffold, implement, and refine code components across multi-step workflows.‚Äù_

Key features from the paper:

- **Decomposition Planning** ‚Äî The model can break down complex prompts into scaffolded code structures.
- **Intent Modeling** ‚Äî Code generation aligns with high-level descriptions of functionality, not just immediate syntax completion.
- **Improved Robustness** ‚Äî The system exhibits higher performance on multi-turn, multi-file code synthesis tasks compared to baseline LLMs.

PurpCode lays the foundation for a more **goal-oriented development workflow**, where the model can operate more like a collaborator than a pure autocomplete engine.

### <MdMemory /> mem0

**mem0** is an **external memory and retrieval system** designed to extend the working memory of large language models. It allows AI agents to **store**, **retrieve**, and **reason across** past generations of code and design decisions.

üîó [Visit mem0.ai](https://mem0.ai) <FaExternalLinkAlt size="0.8em" />

> _‚Äúmem0 enables persistent context for language models ‚Äî enabling consistent and referential code generation over time.‚Äù_

What makes mem0 important:

- **Persistent Memory** ‚Äî Retains and surfaces relevant past interactions, variable declarations, component structures, and API definitions.
- **Semantic Retrieval** ‚Äî Looks beyond keyword overlap to find code by meaning and intent.
- **Conformance + Consistency** ‚Äî Ensures that generated code follows the same patterns, style guides, and structural logic across files and sessions.

In practice, mem0 allows your application to **scale up** ‚Äî by maintaining coherence across larger and more complex codebases over time.

## What Can It Do Right Now?

At this stage, the application focuses on **code generation**. You can use it to:

- Generate **functions, components, classes**, and small services
- Write code in **JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python**, and more
- Refactor or rewrite existing code from natural language
- Preserve structure and context across multiple generations using memory

This makes it ideal for quick prototyping, scaffolding, and structured exploration of new ideas.

---

## Built-in Mini Testing Environment

A lightweight, in-browser testing environment is available for:

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**  
- **Python (non-networked, safe mode)**

You can use this to:

- Preview and run simple scripts or UI mockups
- Interactively tweak and validate generated code
- Debug outputs and understand model assumptions

While this isn‚Äôt a full IDE or deployment pipeline, it gives you a **fast feedback loop** to test code ideas and iterate before exporting.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced language support (e.g., Node.js, frameworks, databases) is currently in progress. This environment is best suited for frontend and basic scripting workflows.

## Example Use Cases

Here are a few example prompts you can try:

```text
"Write a Python script that takes a CSV file and extracts all rows with a missing email address."
