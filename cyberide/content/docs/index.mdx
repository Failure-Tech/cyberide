## Introduction

Hey there! We're Reteena, an R&D Research Lab dedicated to solving progressive issues around Alzheimer's disease. This is documentation regarding our product
cyberide, a tool meant to act as a personal companion and saves memories of patients with Alzeimer's, making sure that no matter how old they get their 
memories will never get lost through time. We have embedded continous contextual prompting and run off Mem0, a memory inferencing layer on top of a base 
agentic model for easier semantic search across all memories stored.

## Project Setup

Retrieve your environment variable keys for the following:

    Gemini: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

    Mem0: https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys
    
    For Neo4j, create a database instance and retrieve the credentials from there directly.

    For Firebase, simply retrieve your credentials from the initialization of a project.

Once these are retrieved, you can create a .env file in your root directory and input them in directly from our example and it should work seamlessly!

## Explanation

Here's a complete breakdown of the functionality of each integrated component and how it all works together!

Login: This is simply a basic Firebase authentication route to confirm whether the user is a recurrent one or not, and if they are not we create an account them with Firebase directly, where everything is stored in that database.

Chat: This is the bulk of our application, where we integrate multiple components. First, we create an agentic setup using Google's Agentic Development Kit and we setup 3 main helper tools integrated with Mem0: one to save memories 
directly to application layer, one to delete those layers, and another one to search through it via the provided methods from Mem0. We also include a suggested memories feature dependent on what the user is currently prompting to our 
agent so that it can create more continous prompting and questioning from both user and agent respectively.

Editor: Here we simply use a Novel Editor wrapper for the textual features, and save the notes through our custom folder structure component that we developed to store the saved notes from the user. We also include calls to the Gemini API 
for specific AI integration to help with spell-checking, writing, and overall linguistic help for the experience we are generating at Reteena.

Graph Editor: Integrated with Neo4j, it displays all of the user's memories directly with a seamless graph interface, using a basic node structure which represents each memory, and through a query sent to AuraDB instead of a local 
instance, it displays all the memories directly. Currently, we are working on integrating a connection from the editor to the graph editor so users can automatically adjust what they see there and what saves in the editor as well.
